### A little About ME:

My name is Bhavan, and I am enrolled in a full-stack web development diploma program at the University of Alberta. I am committed to always enhancing my abilities and broadening my knowledge because I have a passion for technology, programming, and learning new things. I also enjoy spending time outside and participating in activities such as kayaking, hiking, and walking.
